# 🛰️ Satellite Telemetry Visualization & Logging System

A real-time ISS telemetry tracker that simulates and visualizes the International Space Station’s orbit in **3D** and **2D** views.  
Built with **Skyfield**, **VPython**, **Pandas**, and **Cartopy**, this system computes live ISS position data, visualizes its orbit, and logs telemetry for analysis.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Real-time ISS orbit propagation using **Skyfield**
- **3D interactive globe** visualization with **VPython**
- **2D ground track** display with **Cartopy**
- Live telemetry logging to timestamped CSV files
- Modular and extendable structure

---

## 🧭 Installation

Make sure you have **Python 3.9+** installed.

Clone the repository: bash

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Satellite-Telemetry-Visualization-Logging-System.git

cd Satellite-Telemetry-Visualization-Logging-System

If any modules fail (especially Cartopy or VPython), install them manually:
pip install skyfield pandas vpython cartopy numpy matplotlib

## 🚀 Usage
Step 1 — Run the real-time ISS tracker

python iss_tracker_final.py

This launches the 3D VPython globe that simulates and visualizes the ISS orbit in real-time.

Step 2 — Run the 2D map viewer

python map_viewer.py

This opens a 2D Cartopy map that displays the ISS ground track as it moves around the Earth.

Telemetry data (latitude, longitude, altitude, velocity) will automatically be logged into a CSV file inside the data/ folder.
